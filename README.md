# ENP_FILES
This is an empty repo! Files in this directory need to be obtained directly from Kiren!

READ THIS:
ENP_FILES is not intended to be a Git repo. I put this repo here as a place-holder to remind you that you need to obtain this directory directly from Kiren.

ENP_FILES contains many larger files not suitable for version control under Git. These files are version-controlled by appending the date to the filenames. 

ENP_FILES also contains sample input and output files for the ENP_TOOLS so you can test that the scripts work on your system.

ENP_FILES also contains the observed datasets, which are usually replaced en masse when updated.
